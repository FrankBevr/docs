## Are you an Artist?
We are passionate about supporting artists, whether it's by providing them a grant to continue their NFT collection, putting them in our Discord's spotlight, or by featuring them on KodaDot.xyz. 

Our Discord Spotlight is a channel in our [Discord](https://discord.gg/kodadot) where the most passionate projects get the chance to keep close contact with the community (updates, launches, etc). You can also get the chance to be featured on the front page of KodaDot by being active in our community.
 
## Looking to contribute to anything?
  You don't need to be technically or artisically inclined to contribute to KodaDot. We have many opportunities for those like you who want to change the open-source NFT marketplace. We believe one of the best ways to bring a community together is by bringing a challenge amongst themselves. This way, members either learn how to collaborate or innovate.

 We built KodaDot as an open-source community project. Everyone can contribute regardless of their technical ability and dedication. Choose what you're good at and get rewarded. We value high quality effort. Here's what you can do for us:

  - You can become a steward or ambassador -- help us on various non-technical tackling issues like helping around in our 
  [Discord server](https://discord.gg/kodadot), [translating documentation](/incentives/translating-kodadot.md), or [reporting bugs](contests-programs.md#bug-bounty-program).
  - Publish articles for us! We document and publish KodaDot's recent developments on our [Medium](https://medium.com/kodadot).
  - Participate in our [active contests](contests-programs.md). In past we had a contest for KodaDot's new _Discord logo and Animated Banner. Don't worry, more contests are on the way!

## Come say Hi at KodaDot's Meta_Hours!
We have bi-weekly meetings with contributors of KodaDot to share each other's progress as well as future goals in our [Discord sever](https://discord.gg/kodadot). Before speaking, please make sure you're prepared as a [speaker](meta-hours.md).
