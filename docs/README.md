## Looking to contribute to anything?
  You don't need to be technically or artisically inclined to contribute to KodaDot. We have many opportunities for those like you who want to change the open-source NFT marketplace. We believe one of the best ways to bring a community together is by bringing a challenge amongst themselves. This way, members either learn how to collaborate or innovate.

We built KodaDot as an open-source community project. Everyone can contribute regardless of their technical ability and dedication. Choose what you're good at and get rewarded. We value high quality effort. Here's what you can do for us:

  - You can become a steward or ambassador -- help us on various non-technical tackling issues like helping around in our 
  [Discord server](https://discord.gg/kodadot), [translating documentation](/incentives/translating-kodadot.md), or [reporting bugs](contests-programs.md#bug-bounty-program).
  - Publish articles for us! We document and publish KodaDot's recent developments on our [Medium](https://medium.com/kodadot).
  - Participate in our [active contests](contests-programs.md). In past we had a contest for KodaDot's new _Discord logo and Animated Banner. Don't worry, more contests are on the way!

## Come say Hi!
We have bi-weekly meetings with contributors of KodaDot to share each other's progress as well as future goals. Learn more [here](meta-hours.md) and come drop in!

As of April 3rd, 2022, we are hosting a [Gif-memes contest](contests-programs.md#gif-meme-contest)!
