# What is KodaDot?
Serving as the first public good of the Dotsama (Kusama/Polkadot) ecosystem, [KodaDot](https://kodadot.xyz) is an open source NFT marketplace currently running on the [Kusama.network](https://kusama.network). 

Our goal in developing KodaDot as a public good is to become a project where creators, developers, and community members get to contribute and collaborate to ultimately come to the decision that represents the majority. We thrive on becoming an non-exclusive, sustainable environment for contribute who decide to dedicate their time to us. In return for their time, we'll give them bounty rewards as a token of appreciation.  

It's simple, KodaDot's development system was left intentionally open-source, inviting open contribuitions. There isn't "behind the scenes" footage when it comes to us, everyone has a say and a way to communicate their ideas to developers who'd rather work on them than create them.

Later in our journey, we aim to become more carbon neutral while contributing to the carbon negative gallery in an attempt to drive gloral forestation. For now, our efforts lie on a low carbon blockchain, the Kusama network, and partnered with [Offsetra](https://offsetra.com/), a project that us to compensate for our average annual emissions.
