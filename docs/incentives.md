# Incentives 

Our ethos are that we are trying **to be web3-native**. We are trying lowering fulltime members and **best not have any internal team.**

We've learned it's time efficient and capital efficient for us have someone on fulltime on job which is quite rare, **we prefer renting your brain time and send you reward.** We've started with technical focused tasks as it was easier to compose for us and opening doors for non-technical person to join KodaDot with **opportunity being part of KoDAO**. In this way we are building our own Gig Economy apart from our popular and [state of art NFT marketplace KodaDot](https://kodadot.xyz)
