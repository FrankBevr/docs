# Incentivized QA 

To have way faster pace of development, as our current pace of **pull-requests was hitting 250 pull-requests in February on monthly average**, we've realized **we need more people to participate and to share with developers more humble and honest feedback on their work**. 

Result would be that we could deliver user experience quality in shorter time window. 
It's pretty natural that developers sometimes miss delivering the 100% specification in issue or something breaks. Happens and no need to make drama out of it. Everyone is learning.

Till we have e2e tests complete on KodaDot, we would like to **happily reward your participation for your input on our pull-requests to codebase.**

To participate, you must respect our code of conduct below

### Code of Conduct
- Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
- Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
- Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
- Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes, and learning from the experience
- Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall community

You can read more about in our [CODE_OF_CONDUCT](https://github.com/kodadot/nft-gallery/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)

### Rewards
Once we are satisfied with your approach, we can **give you rewards for reviewing our pull-requests.** 

This is still undergoing thought process and experiment to establish fixed amount of rewards for participation. 

**Base range where we value your contribution is around $20-$50.** If there is opportunity you are technical contributor and you make origin pull-request suggestions what and why should be done other way, **the possibility raises up to $100.**
