# Why you should contribute to KodaDot?

![KodaDot_logo_v3](./assets/KODA_v3.png)
## Why I think developers are voluntarily contributing to the KodaDot?
- They can choose to **contribute more or switch and go elsewhere** 
- We literally **don't hold anyone and that's the spirit**. 
- Nowadays contributors choosen us for few things I guess and I've tried named them below.
  
### Size of bounty
- One is size of the bounty because yes people need pay the bills.
- We offer sizeable bounties, starting from **$50** up to **$1000 USD**. 
- Most popular issues are rewarded by **$100 USD** right now, where more refactoring, ringing new reusable component or functionality is usually priced between **$150-300 USD**, depends on your experience and reliability
- Bigger more day issues are priced on range **$450-600 USD**
- You can see current amount of bounty labels **currently available for grab**. Feel free to click on label, solve the challenge and get rewarded

### Flexibility
- Second way how to earn something on the top of primary job. 
- I'm aware that everyone has side hustle nowadays and with **gig economy** is way how we operate more efficiently by our needs and desires. 
- **We don't need to hold anyone on full-time nor tracking hours.** 
- If you spend to make this issue with **three hundreds bucks in five minutes or five hours**, it's solely on the contributor experience and learning curve per se. In short, it doesn't matter how good you are experienced as we are trying giving fixed payouts. Sometimes higher if stuff is tackled quickly.

### Belonging, Squad goals
- Probably **feeling of belonging** as **people meet their friends because of work and shared goals** to create very small religions and tribes and I guess we are trying everything to have right culture in KodaDot.

### Challenging puzzles
- Probably that **we've generated that amount of challenging issues** that **competitive coders are simply attracted to crack on something unusual** than boring corporate job has and can offer. 
- Pushes you **to learn something new and bleeding edge**.
- Drives exploration beyond usual demand from your primary job
- Driving and feeding growth-mindset needs.
- Requires your effort on something new.

### Proof of Contribution to Open Source
- Fifth is probably very important for one, it's **public proof of contribution**, because we are open source. When **we've tried to hire people and been over 200+ applicants**, they send me their resume, I mean what I can do that with piece of PDF? **I was merely looking on their GitHub**, we we're meeting people all around world and I have zero idea of their solid experience and skillset. Only truthful source for me was their public GitHub and Gitlab. 
- Thus when you contribute to KodaDot, you can be definitely assure **they will hire you elsewhere**. 
- Yes it happend already, recieved already three DMs of people **asking me about developers who contributed to Kodadot**, who signed to their company. 

### Bug-hunting -- continuos challenge itself
- Sixth is probably something I would say are glitches, same as **our code has challenging issues**. 
- We got it back by **bug-hunting and looking for ghosts**. Yes we've got ðŸ‘» ghost busters issue recently, so whenever you feel lucky, **we have few ghosts waiting for you in our code**. Like most funny is, how the heck we've managed to have part of Readme of our repository in og: description, and others things like someone made accidentally wrong merging and removed same thing again over which was added in previous Pull-Requests and nothing wrong about it, because at **pace of adding new stuff we can easily loose something important** is we've noticed it's gone or do
