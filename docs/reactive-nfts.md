# Reactive NFTs 

## What's all about?
We had need with our [Kodadot developers contributors](https://github.com/kodadot/nft-gallery) to craft special actions for game creators and be interoperable between other protocols & parachains plus on to be Metaverse-ready for other integrations. 
We've dreamed of things where, **we as creators** can collaborate on crafts together, no matter if it's game items or series of their emotional production, they should have ability to share and influence their featurings. 


## What's in the package?
We plan to pinpoint few major features for our Reactive NFTs out there, highlighting upcoming features
- Auctions (see Basilisk)
- Collab
- Royalties (see Basilisk)
- Make Offers (see Basilisk)
- Revenue Share 
- Verification through holding token
- Reactive Actions
- Advanced Traits System (GameFi-ready)
- Fractions
- Equips
- Scheduler
- Protocol Native Licensing
- Referencing and Bi-linking
- Forking/Remixing
- Loot/Bundles
- Unlockables


## Creative usecases
- Generative art 
- Personalization
- New way of adding utility for NFTs
- Conditional NFTs
  - Looking forward to hyper-personalize your NFTs for whatever you would like to?
  - Art will adjust based on 
    - how much emotes recieved
    - which logged address is looking at art
    - who owns art
    - who sold the art
    - what amount of users owning collection
    - any other on-chain metric we can use as parameter
- No-code/low-code framework
  - Within KodaDot, we enable users to mint their artwork to abstract complexity, starting with generative art and then beyond. 
- Mint your NFT with sub-level details, means it's ready for VRM-based avatars and any other Metaverse standards
- Whenever you are minting with your friends and want to set revenue share within group sales
- When you make collection out of single NFT, you can naturually create DAO holders within your community
- Thanks to linking NFTs you can equip your NFTs with other super powers, where other NFTs are indepedent from state of others
- With Reactive actions you can model your game scenario in like when someone passes one-level, it can automatically recieve soulbond token as achievement
- Want to set timer in your game level? With our scheduler you can adjust whenever procedural levels will be available for players to play.
- You care about licensing, thus with every remix or fork, NFTs will inherit licensing
- Making mystery boxes, loots and bundles of other game items is eternal property of game items, where you can introduce randomness factor into your game
- Don't want to uncover special levels even they would be on-chain? With unlockables would not be issue.

## Release plan
### Basilisk
- With Basilisk deployment we will open flood gates for new range of creators around liqud NFTs.
- Trustless Royalties 
  - This will open doors artists to collect royalty whenever their art will be sold on secondary markets, keeping royalties is vital part of NFTs where it helps drive steady income for artists and open doors to live off their crafts in sustainable way
- Trustless Proxied Royalties 
  - You can redirect portion of your proceeds to some cause. In example, in KodaDot you can drive portion to KodaForest to contribute reforestation in Portugal. 
- Make Offers 
  - Whenever you will mint your art, you can trustlessly recieve offers for your art. This will open new avenue of DeFi apps on top of this offers orderbook.
- Auctions
  - We plan to have Dutch, English and Candle auctions. This would help other people leveraging auctions in their games

## Astar
- WASM support 
  - With Kodadot we would enable developers to fast prototyping stuff right away to deploy their NFT Dapp on Astar.
  - Plan to support basic NFT marketplace with minting and let others expand stuff there

We've felt that protocol in Dotsama are quite opinionated so we come with our own, less-to-no opinionated NFT protocol
