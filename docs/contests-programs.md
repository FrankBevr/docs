# Active Contests
Our contests don't have a strict deadline. We allow entries on an ongoing basis and send rewards out where we see fit. Once we see the attention around a contest becoming dull, we'll stop and move onto another contest. Although entries are welcomed on an ongoing basis, you must adhere to the terms and conditions of said contest.

## Bug bounty program
The main focus of our bug bounty program is to make sure the KodaDot's user experience goes as smoothly as possible. One of our goals is to hunt down possible bugs that may occur during KodaDot's constantly evolving platform.

**NOTE: The more thorough and detailed your bug reports are, the faster a developer can review it and reward you in $KSM. Collaborators and contributors have a say on the significance of the bug and whether or not it should be prioritized, which might affect the speed in which the bug is resolved.**

Feel free to ask in our Discord about the issue you submitted

### Rewards
We reward bounty hunters in $KSM. They can vary from $50 up to $600 depending on the severity of the bug. However, you can become disqualified if you don't follow the Code of Conduct.
