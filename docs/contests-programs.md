# Active Contests
Our contests don't have a strict deadline. We allow entries on an ongoing basis and send rewards out where we see fit. Once we see the attention around a contest becoming dull, we'll stop and move onto another contest. Although entries are welcomed on an ongoing basis, you must adhere to the terms and conditions of said contest.

## Bug bounty program
The main focus of our bug bounty program is to make sure the KodaDot's user experience goes as smoothly as possible. One of our goals is to hunt down possible bugs that may occur during KodaDot's constantly evolving platform.


### Submit a Bug Report
If you come across a bug, please use our [bug report form](https://github.com/kodadot/nft-gallery/issues/new?assignees=&labels=bug&template=bug.yml&title=Be+descriptive+and+short) on GitHub to report and detail your scenario while following the [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/kodadot/nft-gallery/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

NOTE: The more thorough and detailed your bug reports are, the faster a developer can review it and reward you in #KSM.

### Rewards
We reward bounty hunters in $KSM. They can vary from $50 up to $600 depending on the severity of the bug. However, you can become disqualified if you don't follow the Code of Conduct.
