### **What is minting?**

- Minting is a process in which your cryptocurrency wallet and blockchain communicate together and make you able to create nfts.

### **How can i mint nfts?**

### **What's the flow when I'm NFT creator?**

- First of all, you need to install [Polkadot Extension](https://polkadot.js.org/extension), **backup your seed**. Then you can top up your wallet address [here](https://kodadot.xyz/rmrk/credit) or use our [grant](https://tally.so/r/mVP06w) feature.

### **How can i sell KSM i got for my art?**

- Right now, there's plenty of [exchanges](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/kusama#markets) which support KSM trading. The safest are probably [Binance](https://www.binance.com/en) and [Bybit](https://www.bybit.com/en-US/) or try decentralized [simpleswap](https://simpleswap.io/?ref=6cc6e0c538ad).

### **Is there any other way to obtain small amount of KSM?**

- Yes, if for example it's problematic for you to withdraw from an exchange or use fiat-onramp, you may visit our discord and ask for small amount of KSM in [help](https://discord.gg/AkCJPmwJ) channel on our discord to cover minting costs.

### **How can i sell my nft?**

- If you haven't set the price of your nft at the beginning, navigate yourself to your [profile](https://kodadot.xyz/rmrk/u/), choose your NFT in Created and click on LIST, which will make you able to set the price and list your NFT.

### **Royalties streams settings?**

- Right now, we don't have chain logic, but we plan to implement something great, soon. [Stay with us and follow @KodaDot!](https://twitter.com/kodadot)

### **Why did you choose to build on Kusama/Polkadot and not Ethereum?**

- We believe that costs for actions at Ethereum may be high in future and its current PoW is not environmentally friendly. We believe in network effects of Kusama/Polkadot effects from other parachains. A more detailed answer can be found [here](https://github.com/kodadot/nft-gallery/issues/529)

### **What's the difference between creating Classic, Simple and Permafrost?**

- CLASSIC let's you create collection and add NFTs to it. SIMPLE mint will create NFT collectible and add it to your profile and PERMAFROST is nft minting using **Arweave** protocol: The protocol matches people who have hard drive space to spare with those individuals and organizations that need to store data or host content permanently.

### **Are you funded?**

- Right now, we have [Kusama Treasury funding for Milestone 1](https://kodadot.xyz/rmrk/@.common:links.kusama_polkassembly.href). We are actively looking for funding options, eventually we would raise private funds. DMs us, if you are interested into private sale.

### **Do you have Telegram channel?**

- We have only private channel for NFT creators, DM us if you are NFT creator!

### **Will you have AR/VR mode or implementation?**

- Yes, that's part of our Milestone 2, stay tuned!

### **How to open developer console?**

- If you are on Mac, on Chrome hit **Option, CMD, J**, Firefox **Command + Option + K**.

### **How do I update metadata for extension?**

### **I've got \Low balance error**

- Check if you have **transferable** $KSM on your account, not staked. That's different. You can check it at [Dotapps.io > Comptes](https://cloudflare-ipfs.com/ipns/dotapps.io/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Fkusama-rpc.polkadot.io#/accounts) and at balances unfold, you can see there **Transferable** amount.

### **How do I set identity?**

- You can learn more [how to set identity on Kusama network](https://guide.kusama.network/docs/learn-identity).

### **Is there an official KodaDot token?**

### **How can I contribute to the project?**

- We are always welcoming contributions from our community. There are numerous [open issues](https://github.com/kodadot/nft-gallery/issues) for all skill levels - some will even be rewarded in $KSM. [Make your first contribution!](https://github.com/kodadot/nft-gallery/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)

### **Is it possible to move nfts frome one collection to another?**

- No, this possibility is not here at this moment, if you would like to propose a change, feel free to create [issue](https://github.com/kodadot/nft-gallery/issues) on our github

### **What is Kodadot and what is Kusama?**

- Kodadot is an NFT Platform that is community-driven, running on a low carbon footprint blockchain.

- **Kusama** is a pre-production environment for the Polkadot network. "They share the same underlying architecture: a multichain, heterogeneously-sharded design based on "Nominated Proof of Stake (NPoS)" Consensus.

- **$KSM** is the coin used for interacting the Kusama network.

- Since it's a sandbox for early projects which like to move fast and break things on the Polkadot ecosystem, expect Chaos.

### **What can you mint on the Kodadot platform?**

- You can mint practically anything, actual possibilites:


![Options](./assets/faq/support.png)

- All minted files will observe the Code of Conduct and all NSFW (Not Safe For Work) files should be classified NSFW when minting.

### **What is existential deposit(ED)?**

- On the Polkadot network, an address is only active when it holds a minimum amount, currently set at 1 DOT (and 0.0000333333 KSM on the Kusama network). This minimum amount is called the Existential Deposit (ED).


- The ED exists so that accounts with very small balances, or completely empty, do not "bloat" the state of the blockchain in order to maintain high performance and to reduce fees. 
- The existential deposit as of this writing is 0.0000333333  $KSM but maintain 0.1 $KSM in your wallet just to be sure.

### **How much will it cost me to mint an nft?**

- At the time of writing, the fees for minting an nft are 0.02 USD :tada:

### What are NFT royalties?

- Royalties, or royalty payments, are financial payments that are made from one party to another for the ongoing use of their assets. The term is most commonly associated with the music industry, where musicians allow their records to be played on the radio, streamed online, or sampled by other musicians in exchange for a (royalty) fee. However, it isnâ€™t just musicians that are owed royalties when their work is used. Songwriters, composers, publishers, novelists, producers, and just about anybody involved in a creative process has the potential to claim royalties. 

- NFT royalties give artists a percentage of the sale price each time their artwork is resold. No matter how many secondary sales occur, the royalties will always be paid back to the original creator, and the best part is that the whole process is automated. 

### What are fees and why do i need to pay them?

- Transaction fees prevent individual users from consuming too many resources. Polkadot uses a weight-based fee model as opposed to a gas-metering model. As such, fees are charged prior to transaction execution; once the fee is paid, nodes will execute the transaction.

### What are the transfer fees on Kusama?

- It is important to note that the cost of transferring KSM is [dynamic](https://guide.kusama.network/docs/faq/#what-are-the-transfer-fees-for-kusama). Currently, the minimum cost of transferring KSM is 0.01 KSM (the base fee), although this can be changed via governance.
