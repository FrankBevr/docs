### Can I purchase NFTs from my phone?

Yes! Currently the KodaDot's integration with the [Nova wallet](https://novawallet.io/) is in production. We've made a [video walkthrough](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuPAcG4gKzA&t=4s) and written [an article](https://docs.kodadot.xyz/tutorials/how-to-kodadot-phone-ios.html#how-to-mint-nfts-from-ios-device) on how to do this.


## Kusama/KSM


**Kusama** is a pre-production environment for the Polkadot network. "They share the same underlying architecture: a multichain, heterogeneously-sharded design based on "Nominated Proof of Stake (NPoS)" Consensus.
**$KSM** is the coin used for interacting the Kusama network.



### **Why did you choose to build on Kusama/Polkadot and not Ethereum?**
We believe that costs for actions on the Ethereum mainnet will to continue to increase along with its enviornmentally damanging PoW. A more detailed answer can be found [here](https://github.com/kodadot/nft-gallery/issues/529)

### **How can I sell KSM?**
You can sell KSM through [Binance](https://www.binance.com/en) and [Bybit](https://www.bybit.com/en-US/).




### **What is Existential Deposit (ED)?**

On the Polkadot network, an address is only active when it holds a minimum amount, currently set at 1 DOT (and 0.0000333333 KSM on the Kusama network). This minimum amount is called the Existential Deposit (ED).

The ED exists so that accounts with very small balances, or completely empty, do not "bloat" the state of the blockchain in order to maintain high performance and to reduce fees. 
The existential deposit as of this writing is 0.0000333333 $KSM but be sure to keep at least 0.1 $KSM in your wallet avoid consequences.



### What are the transfer fees on Kusama?
The cost of transferring KSM is [dynamic](https://guide.kusama.network/docs/faq/#what-are-the-transfer-fees-for-kusama). Currently, the minimum cost of transferring KSM is 0.01 KSM (the base fee). Although, this can be changed via governance.
