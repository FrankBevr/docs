## How it all Started

Our Co-founder, [yangWao](https://twitter.com/yangWao), was presented an opportunity to research more about [Substrate](https://docs.substrate.io) developers in the Polkadot Econsystem, where he was amazed of its' potential to become a replacement for smaller chains. 

To further understand the space, he created a web-based Subket, where you can:
- Create a Substrate account from a mnemonic and hex seed
- Load your account
- Sign data
- Verify signatures

But he realised, it wasn't easy generating yourself a pair of keys as a Vue developer. Why did it take him a week of translating code from Rust libraries to get things done? 

There was a bigger problem: where was the support for Vue developers?

During yangWao's time researching Substrate, he realised the amount of teams using React to quickly put together their frontends so that they can focus more on the backend. 


***Noticing the little to no Vue support in the PolkdaDot ecosystem, his mission was to make Vue an option alongside React for PolkaDot development***

Teaming up with Co-founder [Viki](https://twitter.com/vikiival), they created [https://vue-polkadot.js.org](https://vue-polkadot.js.org), a collection of Vue.js libraries, utlities and classes that allows for easier use of the Polkadot JS infrastructure inside apps, where they grew tremendously in temrs of technical ability and knowledge of the space.

We were soon awarded a grant from the [Web3 Foundation Foundation](https://medium.com/@web3) in 2019 as Wave 3 Recipients for our contribution to the Polkadot ecosystem, allowing us to further develop and maintain KodaDot. 

## But, KodaDot is a NFT marketplace?!

After finishing [https://vue-polkadot.js.org](https://vue-polkadot.js.org), yangWao and Viki wanted to make their creation useful for **themselves**. At first they created an [Automated Registry](https://hackmd.io/@yangwao/r1nRVC3nL) (which won second place in a PolkaDot hackathon!), but soon found out that the idea itself is unfeasible.

Then they experiemented with AR/VR to [visualize blocks on the blockchain](https://github.com/vue-polkadot/apps/issues/100), which had good traction, but wasn't necessarily what they were looking for.

It was until they found [Bruno Skvorc](https://medium.com/@bitfalls)'s activity surrounding the [RMRK.app](https://www.rmrk.app) on the Kusama Network. Here, they decided to get risky.

Quickly realizing the flexibility of [Substrate Data](https://polkadot.js.org/docs/substrate/extrinsics/#remark_remark-bytes) and skimming the [rmrk-spec repository](https://github.com/rmrk-team/rmrk-spec), they spun up a RMRK.app NFT reader, which gained support from the crypto community. However, this wasn't the idea they wanted to settle with.

Finally, after working non-stop for 7 week and sending in a [proposal](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/motion/256) to become an NFT explorer, is the KodaDot that you know today, serving as the first public good of the Dotsama (Kusama/Polkadot) ecosystem.
