# Contests and other incentive programs

## Thesis
We build KodaDot as open-source community project, which means, everyone can contribute and no one is held here. You can choose what you are good at and simply contribute and get rewarded. We value high quality concepts and quality effort.

Community is built not from the top, but from the roots of specific people, which simply means everyone is welcome. As we do not dwell on short-term speculation, we value long term players. Yes, we are all in the game and you decide how you play it. Our [discord](https://discord.gg/a65X3qs8wh) is like a temple, where most of the stuff gets cooked. A lot of issues are actually discussed there and we always value opinions of community members as there's always a possibility to share freely your opinion and have productive discussion.

## Structure of contests and incentive programs
It's important to note, that most of our contests are ongoing(continuous), as we don't usually put a deadline on, we rather let the wind flow. Once we see that traction for some contest is very low, we either try to upgrade it, or just start a different one. Either way, conditions and certain specifications are always stated in documentation and in the discord-issued channel as a pinned message.

## Rewards
We usually reward all contest participants(if everything is according to rules) in $KSM in short period of time, which simply means, when you have a feeling like you contributed in some form and didn't get rewarded, feel free to reach out to a community manager or simply ask in relevant channel on discord or github issue.

Rewards can vary from $50 up to $600 depending on amount and quality of contribution.

It's also important to carefully read each contest specifications and requests and meet certain conditions which are usually very simple.
