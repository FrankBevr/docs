# Contests and other incentive programs

## Thesis
We build KodaDot as open-source community project, which means, everyone can contribute and no one is held here. You can choose what you are good at and simply contribute and get rewarded. We value high quality concepts and quality effort.

Community is built not from the top, but from the roots of specific people, which simply means everyone is welcome. As we do not dwell on short-term speculation, we value long term players. Yes, we are all in the game and you decide how you play it. Our [discord](https://discord.gg/a65X3qs8wh) is like a temple, where most of the stuff gets cooked. A lot of issues are actually discussed there and we always value opinions of community members as there's always a possibility to share freely your opinion and have productive discussion.

## Structure of contests and incentive programs
It's important to note, that most of our contests are ongoing(continuous), as we don't usually put a deadline on, we rather let the wind flow. Once we see that traction for some contest is very low, we either try to upgrade it, or just start a different one. Either way, conditions and certain specifications are always stated in documentation and in the discord-issued channel as a pinned message.

## Rewards
We reward best contest participants(if everything is according to rules) in $KSM in short period of time, which simply means, when you have a feeling like you contributed in some form and didn't get rewarded, feel free to reach out to a community manager or simply ask in relevant channel on discord or github issue.

Rewards can vary from $50 up to $600 depending on amount and quality of contribution.

It's also important to carefully read each contest specifications and requests and meet certain conditions which are usually very simple.

# Active contests and incentive programs

## Bug bounty program

### Thesis

- Main focus of bug bounty program is to keep KodaDot application as smooth as possible without bugs and flaws. That's a reason why we decided to start a continous and ongoing bug bounty program to motivate users to improve KodaDot app and get rewarded in $KSM!

- One of the goals is to hunt down various glitches that may occur since KodaDot is constantly evolving and to improve user experience as much as possible. Just by using the app, some errors/glitches may occur and instead of closing the app, you can get easily rewarded for this by submitting a bug report.

### Requirements

- It's necessary to visit and follow [code of conduct](https://github.com/kodadot/nft-gallery/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) while reporting a bug.

### How?

- Anytime you spot a bug, please visit our github and use the [bug report form](https://github.com/kodadot/nft-gallery/issues/new?assignees=&labels=bug&template=bug.yml&title=Be+descriptive+and+short) to report and describe what happened to you. It is important to note, that more thorough and well described bug reports have high chance of getting picked up and solved quickly - that simply means that you'll get rewarded shortly after the bug is fixed.

### Rewards
- Rewards are various, from simple bug reports starting at $50 up to complex ones with high possible improvements can climb up to $600. 

- You can expect many other incentives to improve KodaDot, and even if you are not good in finding bugs or just never occured any, feel free to check [stewards](https://discord.gg/a65X3qs8wh) channel in our discord or have a look at contest section.
