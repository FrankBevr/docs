::: warning 
The generated 12-word mnemonic seed is unique phrase, which only you have access to. Store it somewhere safe, it's overally recommended to store it on a paper on multiple places, online storing is not recommended. If you loose this device, you'll be able to restore your access to the wallet with the seed on a different device. Never share your seed phrase

- We leave everything as it is, choose a descriptive name for the account and a password. Remember, the longer the password, the stronger it is

![step9](/polkadot_js_tut/step9.png)

- Congratulations, you've succesfully created polkadot.js wallet! The shown address is a universal address for Polkadot/Kusama ecosystem. 

![step10](/polkadot_js_tut/step10.png)

- By clicking on the three dots, window will show up, enabling you to choose different network. KodaDot is running on Kusama, so you might need your Kusama address if somebody asks you for that. 

::: tip
Sharing your address is completely fine, but keep in mind that all your transactions are visible on blockchain, by default.

![step11](/polkadot_js_tut/step11.png)

- Yey! You've changed the network and you are running now on Kusama relay chain. Send ONLY KSM to this address as this is different from "allow to use on any chain"
