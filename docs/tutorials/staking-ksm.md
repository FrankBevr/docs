#### Congratulations! You've gotten a bounty from a successful PR you submitted- but now what?

If you're converting it to fiat (aww inflation sucks!) or keeping it just in your wallet, maybe you'll want to learn how to make your $KSM work for you without you doing anything! 

## Let's learn about how to stake your $KSM!
This tutorial is intended for nominators (i.e those who are staking to the validators and earning rewards passively).

It's recommended that you [generate](https://guide.kusama.network/docs/learn-account-generation/) a separate Controller (the account that will start/stop staking) AND Stash (the account that will hold large funds) key.

1. Navigate to the Staking option in the Network dropdown menu
![step1](/stake-ksm/1.png)
Here you'll see all the validators, their information, and their statistics.

2. Go to the "Accounts" tab
![step2](/stake-ksm/2.png)

3. Click the "+ Nominator" tab
![step3](/stake-ksm/3.png)

4. You will see a modal pop up
![step4](/stake-ksm/4.png)

Enter an amount in "value bonded" that is LESS than the amount of KSM you have because you also need to pay transaction fees. Please also keep in mind to have a set amount of KSM in your wallet or else it will be considered inactive!

Then, choose your desired payment destination in "payment destination". This is where all your funds from staking will go to. It's recommened that you choose "Stash account (increase amount at stake)" to keep your funds all in one place and earn compound interest.

#### You're now bonded! This means your funds are now able to be staked to validators! It also means that your funds can be slashed (see at the bottom) so do your research!

4. You will now see this screen. Here you can choose the validators you'd like to stake your funds to! 
![step5](/stake-ksm/5.png)

Click Bond & Nominate and you're done!

In order to claim your payouts, you have to navigate to the "Payouts" tab and claim them manually to add your staking rewards to your funds!

## Extras
### How to stop staking

1. Navigate to the "Staking" tab
2. Go to the "Accounts" tab
3. Click "Stop Nominating" on the validator you want to separate from

**This will STOP staking to the validators, if you want to WITHDRAW your KSM, you need to unbond them**

4. To unbond the desired amount, click the three dots next to the account you want to unbond tokens for, and select "Unbond funds".
5. Choose the amount you want to unbond, and you're done!
