# Beginner-friendly intro to digital assets, blockchain and NFTs

## Is this page for you?

- This is ideal place for someone who is getting in touch with web3/digital assets technologies and wants to learn everything at one place.
- This is work in progress and there'll be many links leading to more thorough concepts.

- If you're just getting started in the world of digital assets, then the amount of information may seem a bit overwhelming at first.

- Blockchains, forks, stablecoins, mining, staking, exchanges, security, hardware wallets.. Yup, it seems like there's no ending.

- No worries, nobody says you have to learn everything in one day, in fact, once you understand basic concepts it's very easy.
Digital assets are revolutionary technology, and they bring a whole set of unique concepts with them.

- If you're are just getting started with cryptos, then get ready to forget or recycle many concepts from the legacy financial system.

## What are digital assets?

Let's start from the beginning. What are digital assets? How is it different from a credit card or other instruments from the legacy financial system?

A digital asset is a technology which allows value to be transferred from peer to peer, anywhere in the world, without requiring trust between the parties involved.

Sounds simple, right?

It's a novel technology that allows anyone to become their own bank. When you need to send money to someone else, simply request their address, paste it into a wallet and hit send. That's all there is to it.

Digital assets work from person to person, without a credit card processor, bank or any other middleman involved.

Which brings us to the next subject:

## Value: Decentralizaton

When it comes to digital assets, there is one magic word you'll hear a lot: decentralization.

In fact, decentralization is the single biggest difference between digital assets and the old financial system. Digital assets make feasible a world where the financial system is governed by individuals, not by centralized institutions.

When you type your password into a credit card machine, you're actually not sending funds directly to the salesman. There's at least one bank between you and them (in most cases there may be several banks involved).

You and the salesman both trust the banking institution sitting between you.

You trust that only the amount you authorized will be debited from your account. The salesperson trusts they'll receive the right amount when the credit card balance gets settled.

There's a lot of trust involved here!

The architecture where you trust a middleman to complete a financial transaction is called a centralized architecture. There is a central person or institution that actually carries out the financial transaction on your behalf.

Digital assets, on the other hand, are decentralized.

They do not involve any trust at all. Cryptocurrency systems work because of a solid mathematical foundation, not because you trust the middleman to do the right thing. In one word, digital assets are trustless.

## How is this all possible? Blockchain

### Blockchain definiton:

Blockchain is a shared, immutable ledger that facilitates the process of recording transactions and tracking assets in a business network. An asset can be tangible (a house, car, cash, land) or intangible (intellectual property, patents, copyrights, branding). 
Virtually anything of value can be tracked and traded on a blockchain network, reducing risk and cutting costs for all involved.

### Why is this important?

Why blockchain is important: Business runs on information. The faster it’s received and the more accurate it is, the better. Blockchain is ideal for delivering that information because it provides immediate, shared and completely transparent information stored on an immutable ledger that can be accessed only by permissioned network members. A blockchain network can track orders, payments, accounts, production and much more. And because members share a single view of the truth, you can see all details of a transaction end to end, giving you greater confidence, as well as new efficiencies and opportunities.


The blockchain is just a record of every valid transaction that has ever taken place, and it is the ultimate authority when determining everyone’s balance. 

## Key elements of a blockchain 

### Distributed ledger technology 

All network participants have access to the distributed ledger and its immutable record of transactions. With this shared ledger, transactions are recorded only once, eliminating the duplication of effort that’s typical of traditional business networks.

### Immutable records

No participant can change or tamper with a transaction after it’s been recorded to the shared ledger. If a transaction record includes an error, a new transaction must be added to reverse the error, and both transactions are then visible.

### Smart contracts

To speed transactions, a set of rules — called a smart contract — is stored on the blockchain and executed automatically. A smart contract can define conditions for corporate bond transfers, include terms for travel insurance to be paid and much more.


Next, we will gain an understanding of:

## Decentralization and nodes...what the heck does this mean?

## What is a block? What is the chain?

## How does a transaction work? What is mining?
