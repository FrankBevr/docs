# Create your first mint
### Types of minting
- It's important to note, that on KodaDot there are mainly two minting methods that you can use. We are constantly evolving, so there might be some new methods added, but these two are constant.

### Simple mint
- Simple mint is the easiest way to create nfts. It's a simplified way to begin with, try the technology and look around a bit. Pretty good for from time to time minting, although if you are more of a creator and you want to have your own collection and more features, we recommend to go with Classic mint.
- Both are explained on this page. :muscle:
### Classic mint
- Classic mint however is a little more advanced approach to yourself aswell as to the technology. You start by creating collection first, where you state all the desired details and afterwards you are just adding NFTs to specific collections, according to your needs.
