# Incentivised Bug Reporting

We are building KodaDot for everyone. As we are creators and builders, **we are users of KodaDot**. Sometimes is pretty normal that we doesn't encounter erroneous behaviour or something doesn't work for us. **Quality of KodaDot is based on development iterations and strong feedback loop by it's users. **

Thus if you do encounter error next time, we would really love you to report us back and **reward you for this behaviour.** For us it would be really valuable feedback, because till we will have client side reporting tool, **you might improve comfort of using KodaDot for you in the future and help others.** There is high probability, same error could be encountered by someone else. Yet till, **we aren't aware of bug is happening, we can not fix it.**

**As soon you report it to us, sooner we can push fix to the production. Easy as that.**

### Rewards

We would like to reward you for this behaviour, that for every reported bug which is **reproducible and mitigated.** 
Mitigation means bug fix is merged into `main` branch and you are incentivized to supervise pull-request during time to fix this issue. 

- Current rewards, **depends on complexity of bug.**
- Basic bug reports scales starting **from $50 up to $300.**
- For security bugs range is from **$300 up to $5000.**
