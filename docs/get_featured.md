# How you can be featured on KodaDot?

## Thesis

We are all artists in its way. It is our deep intention  to support artists and starting collections either in form of grant or by being spotlighted on our discord and also on the kodadot.xyz landing page.

By being spotlighted on our discord, creators and collectors get direct contact with you and a lot of stuff can flourish just from that as well as collectors can catch up on your recent updates and new drops.

Artists shape the community as well as collectors. We want to to keep this flowing hence we decided to give chance to high quality artists and collections.

The main point is to shine light on active individuals in the space whose project is heading into long-term direction. As stated already in these docs, our values lie in long term plays rather than short term speculation. Simply bringing value to everyone in the space is what we are trying to achieve as we also could be called a common-good project.
